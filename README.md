A Microsoft Windows [binary](https://github.com/eHealthExperts/k2-creek/releases/latest) that extract data from the electronic health insurance card via [K2](https://k2.ehealthexperts.de/).<br/>
It then extracts relevant fields and writes out some XML/binary files (compatible with WINCrd2XML from Sagem Monetel).

## Requirements
* [K2](https://k2.ehealthexperts.de/) from eHealth Experts GmbH

## Usage

Copy the [binary](https://github.com/eHealthExperts/k2-creek/releases/latest) into a desired folder. After the binary was executed, the card information at the configured K2 path will be written as XML/binary files next to the executable. The following files are created when information is delivered by the card:<br/>

- `eGK_allgemeineVersicherungsdaten.xml`
- `eGK_geschuetzteVersichertendaten.xml`
- `eGK_MFDF_HCA_EF_StatusVD.xml`
- `eGK_MFEFGDO.xml`
- `eGK_PersoenlicheVersichertendaten.xml`
- `eGK_Pruefungsnachweis.xml`
- `KVK_Daten.bin`
- `Result.xml`

For more information of the file content have a look into the WinCrd2XML handbook.

## Configuration
Locate a file `config.ini` next to the binary to configure the URL to work with.<br/>
The following example shows the default values.

```ini
[settings]
scheme=http
host=localhost
port=8080
path=/k2/public/api/1/carddata
force_delete=false
```
* `force_delete` is for avoiding interaction when older generated files were found at the target destination. Setting this to `true` causes automatic deletion.
